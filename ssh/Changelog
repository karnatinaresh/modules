0.2.1:

* Fixed authorized_keys entries being created for the wrong user (thanks egraaf)

0.2.0

* Avoid the need for a new group to hold users allowed and denies access as we
can use the AllowUsers and DenyUsers directives instead.  Also add support for
groups (with an @ prefix) using AllowGroups and DenyGroups.

* Added Rakefile and made puppet-lint fixes.
